# rain
rain is a program that draws a cloud and raindrops that fall across the screen. You are able to change the color of the raindrops with keyboard keys, as well as clear the screen of the raindrops and quit the program. 

To run this program, download the files rain.asm, p3os.asm, and PennSim.jar into their own directory (folder). Run PennSim. 
In the top text box beneath the buttons "Next, Continue...", enter the following commands:

`as p3os.asm`

`as rain.asm`

`ld p3os.obj`

`ld rain.obj`

After you've entered these commands, press the continue button at the top, then click inside of the white box under the large black box on the bottom left. This is the interface for sending text to the program. You may then interact with the program.

The commands you can use to interact with the program are as follows:

Keys | Function
---- | ----
r | changes the color of the raindrops to red
g | changes the color of the raindrops to green
b | changes the color of the raindrops to blue
y | changes the color of the raindrops to yellow
space | changes the color of the raindrops to white
enter (return) | clears the screen of raindrops
q | stops the simulation
